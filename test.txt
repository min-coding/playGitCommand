i am the master

yo it's Min working on Min's branch here. Im expeting to be on main soon.
so i need to 
1. commit to min-branch
2. push to min-branch

but do I have to 
3. merge to master branch on local?
or 
4. merge to master(pull request) on remote? 

well it seems like 4 is actually the way. now im updating the changes to min-branch after merge to see
if we need to merge again to make change to master remote.
