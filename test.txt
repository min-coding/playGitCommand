i am the master

yo it's Min working on Min's branch here. Im expeting to be on main soon.
so i need to 
1. commit to min-branch
2. push to min-branch

but do I have to 
3. merge to master branch on local?
or 
4. merge to master(pull request) on remote? 

well it seems like 4 is actually the way. now im updating the changes to min-branch after merge to see
if we need to merge again to make change to master remote.

The answer to that, yes we need to merge again. 
But git fetch doesn't work this time. let's investigate. Imma commit and push it to remote now.

it seems like, if you already merge branch to master on remote. and you're trying to use git fetch on local,
it wouldn't work. BUT YOU CAN MERGE ON LOCAL, like it's a pull.
